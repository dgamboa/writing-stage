# Mirror Tutorial

Welcome to the Mirror Tutorial! The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the Web 3 development process in the context of a full stack application. Specifically, we'll be bridging common Web 2.0 concepts by building a blog using a Web 3 stack. As you build, we'll introduce key concepts to help you scaffold your development mental model and start adding Web 3 skills into your toolbox.

## Prerequisites

If you know how to program and have [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) experience, you'll be able to complete the tutorial. Having said that, this will be a more comfortable experience if you some experience with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). While you may not have built full stack Web 3 applications, hopefully you have used a crypto wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and you are familiar with basic blockchain concepts like public address, private keys, and signing transactions.

If any of that sounds unfamiliar, or the idea of engaging with those concepts sounds daunting at this point in your learning, we recommend starting with the [Solana Wallet](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/solana-wallet-intro) tutorial before completing this one.

We think of ourselves as your guide - for a brief amount of time - on your journey to build a better internet. We hope you walk away with a better understanding of what it takes to build full stack Web 3 decentralized applications (dApps) and perhaps even a bit more confidence to tackle significant projects.

We've tried to show you the door (or maybe part of it). Your job is to discover your path and walk it courageously.
